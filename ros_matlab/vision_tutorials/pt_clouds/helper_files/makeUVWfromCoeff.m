%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Converts PCA coefficients into scaled 3D vectors for visualizing PCA axes.
%
% In point cloud visualization (pcshow), the axes you're plotting (with
% quiver3) are overlayed onto points which are typically very close to each
% other, often within millimeter-level distances.
%
% Multiplying by a small number (like 0.05) "scales" the PCA axis to a size 
% that fits nicely within the local dimensions of your visualized object. 
% It "extends" clarity rather than actual length, effectively adjusting it 
% from "way too long" to "just right" for visualization purposes.
